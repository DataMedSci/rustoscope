# Rustoscope

WebAssembly image analysis, using Rust.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can view the latest deployed version here:  
🔗 [https://jkbstepien.github.io/rustoscope/](https://jkbstepien.github.io/rustoscope/)

## 📦 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
- [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)

> 💡 Additionally, ensure Rust and `cargo` are installed. If not, install them with:  
> `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
>
> **Note:** We recommend instatllation via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) instead of using your system package manager, as we encountered issues with the `wasm-pack` package in some distributions.
> We tested the project using `1.86.0` version of Rust, thus we recommend using this version or later.

## 📖 Project Structure
